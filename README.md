# Library

- An app that lists book details like book name, author, number of pages, read status.
- One can update the book read status and also remove the book from the library

## Learning Outcomes

To persist data on page load by using local storage. As the read status changes on the UI, same is reflected in the local storage as well. Similar behaviour is adopted for book removal action.
